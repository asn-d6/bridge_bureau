  The Bridge Bureau

== Intro and usage ==

This program analyzes a bunch of bridge extrainfo descriptors and
outputs stats and graphs about the bridges traffic activity. The aim
is to find why and how bridges get underused or overused.

To use this program you need to feed it with extrainfo
descriptors. You can get them from collector:
   https://collector.torproject.org/recent/bridge-descriptors/extra-infos/

You can run the program like this:
    python bureau.py 2015-03-22-12-09-02-extra-infos

== Dependencies ==

More dependencies than needed. Mainly because of the graphs, that are
not optional yet.

You will need stem, matplotlib, scipy, seaborn, numpy, pandas

== Example results ==

Here are some graphs generated by the bureau:
